> 04.01.2020: Repo was updated to use latest changes from [Next 9.3](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-3#next-gen-static-site-generation-ssg-support). Data fetching now uses `getStaticProps` & `getStaticPaths`.

## About

Brevifolia is a minimalist blog starter to get you going with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

This blog is statically generated by Next.js, a rendered combination of react components and markdown / json files. The styles were coded & designed by yours truly, using [styled-jsx](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx) (which is inherently supported by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs#built-in-css-support)). The font used is [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans). Photography from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).

## Project Structure

- Site-level configuration is stored in `data/config.json`.
- Edit styles within each component or page file within the `<style jsx>` tags.
- Global styles live in the `Meta` component.
- `posts/`contains all your markdown blog posts.
- `static/` is where you images live and will get uploaded.
- `pages` is where you page components live.
- The blog pages are dynamically generated with a `slug` parameter. See the template in `pages/blog/[slug].js`.
- The pages & template are comprised of components from `components`.
- The routes are generated at the page level, with the dynamic blog routes being generated by `getStaticPaths` in `pages/blog/[slug].js`.
